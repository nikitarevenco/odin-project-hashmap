# Hashmap

This project was made for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum as part of learning web development. I am leaving these projects up and public for anyone who would want to see my journey to becoming a software engineer. 

## What I Learned

- Principles of the hashmap data structure and how it works under the hood.

## Features

- Hashmap has buckets that automatically scale as the size of the hashmap increases, to reduce collisions.
